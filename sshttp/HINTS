Some things that you can tune to have optimum performance
in general:

- Increase value inside /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn to have larger
  connection backlog queue (10000)
- If somaxconn is increased, you usually dont need to bind to more
  than one CPU, e.g. you can invoke the program with "-n 1"
- have the logfile's on a different HDD than the webroot
- If firewall policy allows, mark HTTP traffic as not-conntracked:
  iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j NOTRACK
